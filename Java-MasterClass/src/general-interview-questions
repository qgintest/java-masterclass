What is OOP (Object Oriented Programmin)?
  is a way to model real world objects as software objects which contain both data and code
    Class - Blueprint/Template that describes the data (fields) and the behavior (methods) that are relevant to the real-world object
     -a.k.a class members (field, method, or other type of dependent element)
     if field is static, there is only one copy in memory, and its value is associated with the class itself.
     also, a static member can't be dependent on any object's state, so it can't reference any instance members

     if a field is nonstatic, its called an instance field, and each object may have a different value stored for its field

       Objects can have
          - state (characteristics of that object)
               stored as variables or attributes
          - behavior (what the object does)
              - exposed as methods

What are getters and setters?
   getters: method on a class that retrieves the value of a private field , and returns it
   setters: method on a class that sets the value of private fields
   purpose of these methods is to control, and protect access to private fields
