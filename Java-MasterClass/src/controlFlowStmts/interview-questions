1. in the switch case, what is considered the altnerative to the else keyword?
    default

2. when is switch statement useful.
    when we are testing a variable against different sets

3. can any data type be used with switch statements?
   No, cannot use long, float, double, or boolean

4. what is the concept of fall-through in a switch case statement?
   if break is not used for the matched case, all remaining cases will be exected, fall-through (assuming break statements are not)

5. What is the yield keyword used for?
   for the enhanced switch expression to return a value back OTHER THAN your cases. has to be inside {} a.k.a code block
   java implicitely uses yeild
    -> "1st";   Implicitely is using {yield: "1st";}

6. Why looping is useful?
    it allows us to execute code repetitely until a condition or set of conditions is met

7. usages of for, while, and do while
     for: used to iterate over a set of values for(init; condition; increment/decrement)
     while: runs code until condition is met (will not run if condition is met before step)
     do-while: executes once and then continues until condition is met

8. Where can break statement be used? what does it do?
    transfers control out of enclosing statement.
    can be used in switch statements, and loops

9. What if you want to loop until some condition is met that is NOT associated with a known range of values?
   use while and do-while loops

10. how is continue different from break;
    continue will go to the next iteration of loop without executing the remaining code in the previous interation
    break will exit out of the loop/method

11. What is a local variable?
    a variable only available in the code block {} where it was declared

12. Variable scope
    scope describes the accessibility of a variable
    in-scope means the variable is used by an executing block or any nested block
    out of scope means the variable is no longer available
