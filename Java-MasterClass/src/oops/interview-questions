1. A class can be described as what?
    - a template of an object(s)
         - a class is like an empty form that gets copied and handed out. after its copied/filled out, the action of that is the object creation. each object is unqiue as it contains
           different information using the class (form) as a template
    - a custom data type
        because you can create variables in the class.
               this is done via static or non-static. on the class level, static must be used.
               for static fields, stored in one place in memory. value is accessed by classname.fieldname
               instance field, not stored in memory. not created until object is created. accessed via object.fieldname
               think of static like data on a form that doesn't change no matter how many times its copied.

    - a special code block that contains variables and methods

    instance/copy of a particular class
