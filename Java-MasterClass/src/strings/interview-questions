String is a sequence of characters that are ordered and indexed.

index:     0    1    2   3   4   5
character: N    A    M   E       .

Different categories of methods available for strings

1. Spring Inspection Methods
   provides info about the string such as
      length() - returns number of characters in a string
      isEmpty() returns true if length is zero
      charAt() returns the character at the index passed
      indexOf() returns the integer, representing the index of the sequence where the String or character is passed
      lastIndexOf()returns the last index
      isBlank() jdk11, returns true if length is zero OR only contains whitespace characters


2. Methods for Comparing String values
    returns boolean with equal() methods
    contentEquals() true if strings value equal to what is passed. can use any character sequence apart from Strings
    equals() true if strings value equal to what is passed
    equalsIgnoreCase() true if strings value equal to what is passed ignoring cases
    contains()
    endsWith()
    startsWith()
    regionMatches() true if defined sub-regions are matched


3. String Manipulation Methods
    transform string values to another
    ident() jdk15+, adds or removes spaces from the beginning of lines in multi-line text.
    strip() - removes whitespace for larger sets
    stripLeading()
    stripTrailing()
    trim() removes whitespace
    concat() - concates string and returns new String as a result
    join() - allows multiple string to be concatendated together in a single method, specifying a delimtter
    repeat() - returns the string repeated by number of times specified in the argument
    replace() - replaces characters in a string based on a specified character or string
    replaceAll() - similar to above but based on a regular expression
    replaceFirst()
    subString() - returns part of a string specified by index

    Difference between String and StringBuilder
    String - immutable, always returns new instance of a string and trashes the old instance
    a.k.a they create new objects in memory and return a reference to the new object.

    StringBuilder - mutuable class that lets us change its text value
       4 overloaded methods
          - Pass a string                          new StringBuilder("String")
          - Pass no args                           new StringBuilder()
          - Pass an integer                        new StringBuilder(1)
          - pass another character sequence        new StringBuilder(builder)

       methods also include
         -delete() - delete  substring using indices or delete a single character
         -deleteCharAt()
         -insert() insert text at a specified position
         -reverse() - you can reverse the order of the characters in the sequence
         -setLength() - setLength can be used to truncate the sequence or include null sequences to fill out sequence of the length
